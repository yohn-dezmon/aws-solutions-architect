# AWS Regions 

example region: `us-east-1`  
Example Availability Zone: `us-east-1a`  

each availability zone is composed of min 3, and max 6 data centers.  
Each availability zone is connected by high bandwidth low latency networks.  

How to decide on an AWS Region?
- proximity/latency 
- compliance
- service availability 
- pricing: different regions have different prices

Points of Presence (I think these are CDNs):
- 400+ PoPs in 90+ cities in 40+ countries. 
- low latency for end users
